    <p><em>Swing dance </em> is a group of social dances that developed with the swing style of jazz music in the
      1920s‚Äì1940s,
      with
      the
      origins of each dance predating the popular "swing era". Hundreds of styles of swing dancing were developed; those
      that
      have survived beyond that era include Lindy Hop, Balboa, Collegiate Shag, and Charleston. Today, the
      best-known of
      these dances is the Lindy Hop, which originated in Harlem in the early 1930s.
      <br />
      <br />While the majority of swing
      dances
      began in African-American communities as vernacular African-American dances, some influenced swing-era dances,
      like
      Balboa, developed outside of these communities.
      <br />
      <br />
      "Swing dance" was not commonly used to identify a group of dances until the latter half of the 20th century.
      Historically, the term swing referred to the style of jazz music, which inspired the evolution of the dance.
      Jitterbug
      is any form of swing dance, though it is often used as a synonym for the six-count derivative of Lindy Hop called
      "East
      Coast Swing". It was also common to use the word to identify a kind of dancer (i.e., a swing dancer). A
      "jitterbug"
      might prefer to dance Lindy Hop, Shag, or any of the other swing dances. The term was famously associated with
      swing
      era
      band leader Cab Calloway because, as he put it, "[The dancers] look like a bunch of jitterbugs out there on the
      floor
      due to their fast, often bouncy movements."
      <br />
      <br />
      The term "swing dancing" is often extended to include other dances that do not have certain characteristics of
      traditional swing dances: West Coast Swing, Carolina Shag, East Coast Swing, Hand Dancing, Jive, Rock and Roll,
      Modern
      Jive, and other dances developed during the 1940s and later. A strong tradition of social and competitive boogie
      woogie
      and Rock 'n' Roll in Europe add these dances to their local swing dance cultures.
